# 🚀 Projects by Priyanshu Singh

Welcome to my repository!  
This repo contains two of my key hackathon projects developed during **Hackmanthan 2025 at Lovely Professional University (LPU)**.  
Both projects focus on **AI-driven accessibility and inclusivity** — leveraging machine learning and web technologies to make information more reachable for everyone.

## 🧠 Project 1: AI Content Translator

### 🌍 Overview
The **AI Content Translator** is an accessibility-focused web tool that allows users to:
- Upload **PDFs** or type text manually.
- Translate it into **multiple languages**.
- Listen to it using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality.

It’s built to assist **visually impaired users**, educators, and multilingual learners by bridging the gap between text and speech in multiple languages.
